# Oshop

(This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.)
A mock online grocery store built with Angular 5, Firebase, and Bootstrap 4. Anonymous users can look through, filter, and add items to a shopping cart. Authentication (currently via Google OAuth api) is necessary to "check-out," as well as see previous orders. All site, user, and product info is stored in a Firebase database which serves as the backend.

## Important
Before you can run this app on your machine, you must create your own Firebase project (https://firebase.google.com/ > get started > + add project) and replace settings in /src/environments with settings of your own Firebase project.

## Running the application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
